== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is errnio? =
errnio adds gesture based products to the mobile view of your site, and enhances user engagement with additional mobile functionality. errnio allows you to enjoy added revenue for your mobile traffic while any other monetization units continue to work undisturbed (no banners or ads).

= What is the difference between errnio and other monetization units? =
Glad you asked, other then the fact that errnio is a new type of monetization relying on the user's finger movements across your website, it also contains NO banners or popups!
Most monetization products for mobile compete with each other for the same space they take on you site. **errnio** can live side by side with any banner (or display/ad unit) and you can profit from two revenue streams rather then only one.

= Does errnio run on desktop screens? =
Niet!

= After I download the plugin, what do I do to get my money? =
After you installed the plugin you should get a notification requesting your site-id.
Go to our site, <a href="http://www.errnio.com/" target="_blank">errnio.com</a> and register. Once you've done this, you'll get a site-id which you can paste into the options page of the plugin (follow the notification).
After everything is ready you can manage your plugin on the errnio dashboard and collect your revenues.

We have a simple revenue share program which you can access once registered.
